# x86-Assembly-Basic-OS
A primitive x86 program that runs on an online emulator.
Link to the online emulator: http://carlosrafaelgn.com.br/asm86/

Two files are included in this repository, a raw text file which contains the x86 code and a file that is used to import the code into the online emulator. Use the file names asm86.txt to import the file into the emulator. rawCode.txt is a more readable version of the code but will not compile in the emulator.
